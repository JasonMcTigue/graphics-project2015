## **Space Pong**
Space pong is a small addictive 2D game I created using HTML5 and JavaScript.

**Objective:** The objective of space pong is to simply score 15 points to win. You earn points by successfully hitting the ball against one of the two paddles. Each time you hit a paddle the score will increase by one.

However the more points you score the more difficult the game will become. When the ball turns red this indicates an increase in speed.

You can choose to play the game on your **own** by using the arrow keys to take control of **both** paddles.
Or you can team up with **another player** and take control of a paddle **each**.

##Controls
| |   |   
|---|---|
| Left Arrow | Moves **Both** Paddles left  |   
|  Right Arrow | Moves **Both** Paddles right  |   
|  q | Moves the **bottom** paddle **left**  |   
|  w | Moves the **bottom** paddle **right**  |   
|  o | Moves the **top** paddle **left**  |   
|  p | Moves the **top** paddle **right**  |   

## Concepts used
